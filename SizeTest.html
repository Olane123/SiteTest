     <h1>Xilonen</h1>
     <p>Shilonen is a fiveâ€”star character in the Genshin Impact game who wields a Geo-element and a one-handed sword. She is a blacksmith from the Natlan region and is known for her forging skills.
        Shilonen takes a responsible approach to each order, carefully clarifying all the details before starting work. However, she can often be found relaxing away from the forge, which indicates her desire for a work-life balance. 
        In battle, Shilonen plays the role of support, capable of strengthening allies and dealing damage. Her elemental skill allows her to switch to roller skates, which allows for fast movement and Geo-damaging attacks.</p>
